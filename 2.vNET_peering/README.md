**Gateway Subnet**
A Gateway Subnet is a subnet in a virtual network (VNet) that is dedicated to the network virtual appliances (NVAs) that provide services, such as firewall protection, VPN gateway, or routing. The Gateway Subnet is required to host the Azure VPN gateway or Azure ExpressRoute gateway resources.

The Gateway Subnet is typically smaller in size than the other subnets in the VNet and has a larger number of reserved IP addresses to accommodate the IP addresses of the network virtual appliances. This subnet is also isolated from the rest of the subnets in the VNet to provide better security and prevent unauthorized access to the NVAs.

In summary, the Gateway Subnet is a subnet in a virtual network that is used to host the network virtual appliances that provide network services to the virtual network and its connected resources.
**Azure Firewall subnet**
An Azure Firewall subnet is a subnet in an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) that is dedicated to hosting an Azure Firewall resource. Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It provides centralized network security management and network traffic control capabilities, allowing you to control access to and from your VNet.

When you create an Azure Firewall, you must associate it with a subnet in your VNet. The subnet that you associate with the firewall must be a separate subnet from the other subnets in your VNet, and it is typically named "AzureFirewallSubnet". This subnet is used to host the Azure Firewall instance, and it is where the firewall virtual appliance is deployed.

In summary, an Azure Firewall subnet is a subnet in a virtual network that is used to host an Azure Firewall resource, providing centralized network security management and traffic control capabilities for your virtual network.
